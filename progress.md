# Time Tracker Project Progress V3

## Core Design Principles

1. Progressive integration with validation between steps
2. Serial print monitoring for feedback and debug
3. Structured and documented code
4. Simple and reliable RFID detection

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: RFID Switch Foundation âœ…

Starting point: Working RFID switch code from main.cpp

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Hardware]
    B --> C[Poll RFID]
    C --> D{Tag Present?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Set LED Green]
    D -->|No| F[Set LED Blue]
    E --> G[Debug Output]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Wait 1s]
    H --> C
```

Core Functionality:

- [x] Basic RFID tag detection (success true/false)
- [x] LED feedback (blue=waiting, green=detected)
- [x] Serial debugging output
- [x] 1-second polling interval

Validation Checkpoints:

- [x] Consistent tag detection
- [x] Clear LED state indication
- [x] Proper serial output
- [x] Stable operation over time

Implementation Notes:

- Added tag type detection (Mifare Classic 4-byte, ISO14443-4 7-byte)
- Optimized I2C communication with recovery time
- Enhanced debug output with tag type information
- Improved timing control for stable readings

### Phase 2: WiFi Integration

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Hardware]
    B --> C[Connect WiFi]
    C --> D[Poll RFID]
    D --> E{Tag Present?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Set LED Green]
    E -->|No| G[Set LED Blue]
    F --> H[Send POST]
    H -->|Success| I[Debug Output]
    H -->|Fail| I
    G --> I
    I --> J[Wait 1s]
    J --> D
```

Building on validated RFID switch:

- [x] WiFi connection with multi-SSID support
- [x] Connection status via LED
- [ ] Basic webhook defined in credentials.h
- [ ] Simple POST on tag detection

Validation Checkpoints:

- [x] WiFi connects reliably
- [x] LED shows connection status
- [ ] Webhook receives basic POST
- [ ] System remains stable

### Phase 3: Storage Implementation

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Hardware]
    B --> C[Mount SPIFFS]
    C --> D[Connect WiFi]
    D --> E[Poll RFID]
    E --> F{Tag Present?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Set LED Green]
    F -->|No| H[Set LED Blue]
    G --> I[Write Log]
    I --> J[Send POST with Logs]
    H --> K[Debug Output]
    J --> K
    K --> L[Wait 1s]
    L --> E
```

After stable network operation:

- [ ] Initialize SPIFFS
- [ ] Create and manage log.csv
- [ ] Log tag events with timestamp
- [ ] Include logs in webhook payload

Validation Checkpoints:

- [ ] SPIFFS mounts properly
- [ ] Logs written correctly
- [ ] File rotation works
- [ ] Payload includes logs

### Phase 4: Enhanced Communication

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Hardware]
    B --> C[Mount SPIFFS]
    C --> D[Connect WiFi]
    D --> E[Process Queue]
    E --> F[Poll RFID]
    F --> G{Tag Present?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Set LED Green]
    G -->|No| I[Set LED Blue]
    H --> J[Write Log]
    J --> K{Send POST}
    K -->|Success| L[Debug Output]
    K -->|Fail| M[Queue Payload]
    M --> L
    I --> L
    L --> N[Wait 1s]
    N --> E
```

Once storage is validated:

- [ ] Improved webhook payload structure
- [ ] Failed payload queueing
- [ ] Automatic retry on reconnection
- [ ] Enhanced LED patterns for status

Validation Checkpoints:

- [ ] Payloads sent successfully
- [ ] Queue system works
- [ ] Retries function properly
- [ ] LED patterns are clear

## Current Status

Phase 1 completed successfully:

- Implemented reliable RFID detection for multiple tag types
- Optimized I2C communication and timing
- Added comprehensive debug output
- Validated all checkpoints

Ready to begin Phase 2: WiFi Integration
